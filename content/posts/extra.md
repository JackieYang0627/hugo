## ChinaBlue 

China Blue will produce weekly aired radio shows through WUSB, Stony Brook 90.1 FM educating students and the public about recent issues regarding the Chinese community.  Due to the multilingual aspect of Chinese dialects, the show will alternate between Cantonese and Mandarin on a weekly basis.  Audiences are encouraged to call to request songs or join discussions on our weekly topic.  China Blue will also serve as a bridge between their audiences and other organizations affiliated with China Blue by voicing and advertising through our weekly broadcasting program.  Clubs affiliated with us will have the advantage to advertise and market through our services.  Aside from the weekly shows, China Blue will also be hosting several events throughout the semester or partner events with other clubs addressing culture awareness and appreciation
